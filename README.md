## Welcome to my e-notebook!
You can access my notebook by <https://Tsukimakura.github.io/My-notebook/>

The website contains some of my notes of CS learning(main) and other fields.
Most of the notes on the website have not been checked yet.
I'll keep updating my notes in the future.
Hope this website helps you.

I'll appreciate it if you point out the mistakes or give me some suggestions.
You can contact me at <chenlingshi@zju.edu.cn>

* You'll see lots of AI-generated content on the website, thanks to my learning method.
