We return i in Lomuto scheme, which is the index of the pivot after swapping. In Hoare scheme, after the whole loop, j is the maximal index of the left range( &lt;= pivot), while i is the minimal index of the right range( &gt;= pivot). So we usually return j and recursively sort (l, p) &amp; (p+1, r), which is respectively the left range and the right range.What's more, since we don't really know where is the pivot in Hoare partition, we can't just recursively sort (l, p-1) &amp; (p+1, r)\uff0c where p is the pivot's index, like what Lomuto does.</p> </li> <li> <p>In Hoare scheme, why do-while, not while: to avoid infinite loop.      if arr = {2, 2}:     <code>c     while (arr[i] &lt; pivot) i++;      while (arr[j] &gt; pivot) j--;      if (i &lt;= j) {          swap(arr[i], arr[j]);      }</code>     i never moves, so does j. They just keep swapping all the time, forming an infinite loop.     do-while just avoid this case by manipulating i and j first.     we can also use while and add <code>i++</code> and <code>j--</code> in <code>if(i &lt;= j){...}</code> , but this is apparently not so simple and beautiful as the standard version.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pros and cons of the two schemes</p> <ol> <li> <p>Lomuto Partition Scheme</p> <ul> <li> <p>Mechanism: Uni-directional.

I'll update it based on my new understanding (2026-01-08):</p> <p>ISO C11 (6.3.2.1p3) \"...an expression that has type 'array of type' is converted to an expression with type 'pointer to type' that points to the initial element of the array object and\u00a0is not an lvalue.\"</p> <p>An array name itself (before decay) is a non-modifiable lvalue (Unlike a\u00a0const\u00a0pointer variable, which resides in memory and holds an address, an array name\u00a0is\u00a0the identity of the memory block itself.) representing the entire array. (An lvalue is an expression that designates an object.).  During compilation, the compiler have decided the location of the array, and there's no place in the memory to store the address <code>n</code> itself. This is not different from any other variables, since when <code>int x</code>, there's a space for the object designated by x in the memory, but no space for x itself.  (The compiler resolves the address of <code>x</code> \u2014 which is the address of the object designated by the identifier \u2014 via stack offsets or symbol table entries). The reason why we can modify the value of <code>x</code> , but not the value of n, is that <code>x</code> represents the contents in the four bytes (usually), while the array name represents the entire array itself. (This also explains why we can't assign value to the array by <code>Array_name1 = Array_name2</code>). The C standard defines an array name as a non-modifiable lvalue to prohibit operations like <code>n = ...</code> or <code>n++</code>, thereby preventing any attempt to rebind the base address of the array (i.e., making the array name refer to a different memory location).</p> <p>In brief, </p> <p>To prove the things mentioned above, we can use <code>&amp;Array_name</code> to get the address of the whole array (only lvalue an be the operand of <code>&amp;</code> ), and test the properties (it's the address of the array, not the first element).</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main() {\n    int a[3];\n    printf(\"Size of *(&amp;a): \u00a0 \u00a0%zu\\n\", sizeof(*(&amp;a)));\n    printf(\"Size of *(&amp;a[0]): %zu\\n\", sizeof(*(&amp;a[0])));\n    // Through *(&amp;a), we get the whole array(which is equal to the array name).\n    // Since sizeof doesn't cause decay(see in subtitle 4),we can reach the goals.\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Another plan:</p> <pre><code>int main() {\n    int a[3];\n    int *p = &amp;a; // Write wrong type on purpose, and suppose the compiler to give the true types by warning.\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>In most expressions (except some special circumstances in subtitle 4), the array name decays into an rvalue representing the address of the first element.
